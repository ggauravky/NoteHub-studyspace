          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>📖 Definition</h4>
            <p>
              A <strong>tissue</strong> is a group of similar cells that work
              together to perform a specific function.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 Think of it Like This</h4>
            <p>
              Imagine a cricket team! Just like 11 players work together to win
              a match, many similar cells work together as a tissue to do a
              particular job. For example, muscle cells group together to form
              muscle tissue that helps you move!

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Division of Labor</h4>
            <p>
              In multicellular organisms, different tissues perform different
              functions. This is called <strong>division of labor</strong>. It
              makes the organism more efficient - just like in a factory where
              different workers do different jobs!
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">2. Plant Tissues</h2>

          <p>
            Plant tissues are divided into two main types: Meristematic Tissue
            and Permanent Tissue.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">2.1 Meristematic Tissue</h3>

          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>📖 What is Meristematic Tissue?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Meristematic tissue</strong> consists of cells that can
              divide and form new cells. These are found in the growing regions
              of plants.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 Real-Life Understanding</h4>
            <p>
              Think of meristematic cells as "baby cells" or "growth cells"!
              They're like kids who keep growing. These cells are found where
              the plant is growing - tips of roots and shoots. That's why plants
              grow taller from top and roots grow deeper!
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="key-points">
            <h4>🔑 Characteristics of Meristematic Tissue</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Cells are small and compact</li>
              <li>Cells have thin cell walls</li>
              <li>Cells have large nucleus</li>
              <li>No intercellular spaces (tightly packed)</li>
              <li>Cells divide continuously</li>
              <li>No vacuoles (or very small)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Types of Meristematic Tissue (Based on Location)</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Apical Meristem:</strong> Found at tips of roots and
              shoots. Helps in increasing length (height of plant).<br /><br />
              <strong>2. Lateral Meristem:</strong> Found on sides of stem and
              roots. Helps in increasing thickness (girth of plant).<br /><br />
              <strong>3. Intercalary Meristem:</strong> Found between mature
              tissues, like at base of leaves. Helps in growth of leaves and
              internodes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">2.2 Permanent Tissue</h3>

          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>📖 What is Permanent Tissue?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Permanent tissue</strong> consists of cells that have
              stopped dividing. They have attained a definite shape, size, and
              function. They are formed from meristematic tissue.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 Think of it Like This</h4>
            <p>
              If meristematic cells are like kids who keep growing, permanent
              tissue cells are like adults who have stopped growing and now do
              specific jobs! Once they mature, they specialize in particular
              tasks.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Permanent tissues are of two types: Simple Permanent Tissue and
            Complex Permanent Tissue.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">2.2.1 Simple Permanent Tissue</h3>

          <p>Made up of only one type of cells.</p>

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Types of Simple Permanent Tissue</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Parenchyma:</strong><br />
              • Most common plant tissue<br />
              • Cells are living, thin-walled, and loosely packed<br />
              • Have large intercellular spaces<br />
              • Store food, provide support<br />
              • In leaves, they contain chloroplasts and perform photosynthesis
              (called chlorenchyma)<br />
              • In aquatic plants, they have air cavities for floating (called
              aerenchyma)<br /><br />

              <strong>2. Collenchyma:</strong><br />
              • Cells are living with thickened corners<br />
              • Provide mechanical support and flexibility<br />
              • Found in leaf stalks, below the epidermis<br />
              • Allow bending without breaking (like a rubber band)<br /><br />

              <strong>3. Sclerenchyma:</strong><br />
              • Cells are dead with very thick walls (due to lignin)<br />
              • Provide strength and hardness<br />
              • Found in stems, around vascular bundles, in seed coats, nut
              shells<br />
              • Make plant parts hard and stiff
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>💡 Example: Coconut Shell</h4>
            <p>
              The hard coconut shell is made of sclerenchyma tissue! That's why
              it's so hard and tough. Similarly, the gritty texture you feel
              when eating pears is due to sclerenchyma cells called stone cells!
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">2.2.2 Complex Permanent Tissue</h3>

          <p>Made up of more than one type of cells working together.</p>

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Types of Complex Permanent Tissue</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Xylem:</strong><br />
              • Conducts water and minerals from roots to other parts<br />
              • Made of 4 types of cells: Tracheids, Vessels, Xylem parenchyma,
              Xylem fibers<br />
              • Tracheids and vessels are tubular and dead<br />
              • Water moves upward through these tubes<br />
              • Also provides mechanical support<br /><br />

              <strong>2. Phloem:</strong><br />
              • Transports food (prepared in leaves) to all parts of plant<br />
              • Made of 4 types of cells: Sieve tubes, Companion cells, Phloem
              parenchyma, Phloem fibers<br />
              • Sieve tubes are living (no nucleus) with perforated walls<br />
              • Companion cells help sieve tubes<br />
              • Food can move both upward and downward
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 Real-Life Understanding</h4>
            <p>
              Think of xylem and phloem as the plant's plumbing system!<br />
              • <strong>Xylem</strong> is like water pipes bringing water from
              underground tank (roots) to all floors (parts)<br />
              • <strong>Phloem</strong> is like delivery trucks transporting
              food from kitchen (leaves) to all rooms (parts)<br /><br />
              Together, they're called vascular tissue - the plant's transport
              system!

          <h3 class="sub-heading">2.3 Protective Tissues in Plants</h3>

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Epidermis</h4>
            <p>
              • Single layer of cells covering the entire plant body<br />
              • Protects plant from water loss, injury, infection<br />
              • In leaves, has small pores called <strong>stomata</strong> for
              gas exchange<br />
              • Stomata have guard cells that open and close the pore<br />
              • In desert plants, epidermis is thick with waxy coating (cuticle)
              to prevent water loss<br />
              • May have hair-like structures (trichomes)
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Cork</h4>

              • In older plants, outer layer of epidermis is replaced by cork<br />
              • Made of dead cells without intercellular spaces<br />
              • Cell walls are thick due to deposition of suberin (waxy
              substance)<br />
              • Protects plant from mechanical injury, water loss, temperature
              changes<br />
              • Does not allow gas exchange, so has lenticels (small pores)<br />
              • Example: Cork of bottle comes from bark of cork oak tree!

            <h4>💡 Why Do Leaves Have Stomata?</h4>
            <p>
              Stomata are like tiny doors on leaves! They open during day to let
              CO₂ in for photosynthesis and let O₂ out. They also help in
              releasing excess water (transpiration). At night, they close to
              prevent water loss. Smart, isn't it?

          <p>
            Animal tissues are classified into four main types based on their
            function: Epithelial Tissue, Connective Tissue, Muscular Tissue, and
            Nervous Tissue.

            <h4>📖 What is Epithelial Tissue?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Epithelial tissue</strong> forms the protective covering
              of the body and lines internal organs and cavities.

              Epithelial tissue is like the wallpaper or tiles in your house! It
              covers all surfaces - outer (skin) and inner (lining of stomach,
              intestines, blood vessels). It's the protective covering!

            <h4>⚡ Types of Epithelial Tissue (Based on Structure)</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Simple Epithelium:</strong> Single layer of cells<br />
              • <strong>Squamous (flat):</strong> Found in blood vessels,
              alveoli (air sacs in lungs). Allows easy diffusion.<br />
              • <strong>Cuboidal (cube-shaped):</strong> Found in kidney
              tubules, glands. Provides mechanical support.<br />
              • <strong>Columnar (column-shaped):</strong> Found in intestine,
              stomach lining. Helps in absorption and secretion.<br />
              • <strong>Ciliated (with hair-like cilia):</strong> Found in
              respiratory tract. Cilia move to push out dust and mucus.<br /><br />

              <strong>2. Stratified Epithelium:</strong> Multiple layers of
              cells<br />
              • Found in skin, mouth, esophagus<br />
              • Provides protection against wear and tear<br />
              • Upper layers keep replacing as they wear out<br /><br />

              <strong>3. Glandular Epithelium:</strong><br />
              • Specialized for secretion<br />
              • Forms glands that secrete substances (sweat, saliva, hormones,
              digestive juices)
            </p>

            <h4>💡 Example: Why Skin Heals Quickly</h4>
            <p>
              When you get a small cut, your skin heals within days. This is
              because epithelial cells of skin divide rapidly to replace damaged
              cells. That's why epithelial tissue is great at repair!

              structural framework that holds everything together! It connects
              different parts, provides support, and fills spaces - like foam
              packaging protects items in a box.

            <p>
              <strong>1. Areolar Tissue:</strong><br />
              • Found between skin and muscles, around blood vessels and
              nerves<br />
              • Fills spaces, provides support<br />
              • Helps in tissue repair<br /><br />

              <strong>2. Adipose Tissue:</strong><br />
              • Stores fat below the skin and around organs<br />
              • Acts as insulator (keeps body warm)<br />
              • Acts as shock absorber<br />
              • Provides energy reserve<br /><br />

              <strong>3. Dense Connective Tissue:</strong><br />
              • Forms tendons (connect muscles to bones) and ligaments (connect
              bones to bones)<br />
              • Very strong and has great tensile strength<br /><br />

              <strong>4. Cartilage:</strong><br />
              • Solid but flexible<br />
              • Found in nose, ear, joints between bones<br />
              • Provides support and reduces friction<br />
              • No blood vessels<br /><br />

              <strong>5. Bone:</strong><br />
              • Hardest connective tissue (due to calcium and phosphorus
              salts)<br />
              • Forms skeleton<br />
              • Provides shape, support, protection<br />
              • Bone marrow produces blood cells<br /><br />

              <strong>6. Blood:</strong><br />
              • Liquid connective tissue<br />
              • Plasma (liquid matrix) contains blood cells<br />
              • Red Blood Cells (RBCs) carry oxygen<br />
              • White Blood Cells (WBCs) fight infections<br />
              • Platelets help in blood clotting<br />
              • Transports nutrients, hormones, waste

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>💡 Example: Why Blood is Connective Tissue</h4>
            <p>
              You might wonder - blood is liquid, how is it connective tissue?
              Blood connects all parts of body by transporting materials! It
              carries oxygen from lungs to cells, food from intestine to cells,
              and waste from cells to kidneys. It's the body's transport system!

            <h4>📖 What is Muscular Tissue?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Muscular tissue</strong> consists of elongated cells
              called muscle fibers that can contract and relax, producing
              movement.

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 Think of it Like This</h4>
            <p>
              Muscle cells are like rubber bands that can stretch and shrink!
              When they contract (shorten), they pull bones or organs, causing
              movement. Your every movement - walking, eating, even blinking -
              involves muscles!

              <strong>Voluntary muscles:</strong> You can control them. Try
              moving your hand - you decide when to move it. These are skeletal
              muscles.<br /><br />
              <strong>Involuntary muscles:</strong> You cannot control them.
              Your heart keeps beating, stomach keeps digesting food even when
              you're sleeping! These are smooth and cardiac muscles.

              Nervous tissue is like the internet or telephone network of your
              body! It receives information (you touch hot pan), processes it in
              brain, and sends response (pull hand back) - all in milliseconds!

              <strong>Parts of a Neuron:</strong><br />
              1. <strong>Cell Body:</strong> Contains nucleus and cytoplasm<br />
              2. <strong>Dendrites:</strong> Short, branched projections that
              receive messages from other neurons<br />
              3. <strong>Axon:</strong> Long projection that carries messages
              away from cell body to other neurons or muscles<br />
              4. <strong>Nerve Ending:</strong> Terminal branches of axon that
              pass message to next neuron<br /><br />

              The junction between two neurons is called a
              <strong>synapse</strong>.

            <h4>💡 Practice Questions</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Q1.</strong> Why do plants have more dead tissue compared
              to animals?<br />
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Plants don't move, so they need more
              supportive and protective tissues. Dead tissues like sclerenchyma
              and xylem vessels provide this support. Animals move, so they need
              living, flexible tissues.
            </p>

              <strong>Q2.</strong> Name the tissue present in the brain.<br />
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Nervous tissue (made of neurons).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Q3.</strong> Why are xylem and phloem called complex
              tissues?<br />
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Because they are made up of more than one
              type of cells working together.
