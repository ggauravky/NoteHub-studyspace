            <h4>📖 Overview</h4>
            <p>
              This biography portrays the strong willpower and determination of
              <strong>Santosh Yadav</strong>. Born in a society where the birth
              of a son was a blessing and a daughter was not welcomed, she
              defied traditional norms to chart her own path and become the only
              woman in the world to scale <strong>Mount Everest twice</strong>.

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ A Rebel from Birth</h4>
            <p>
              • <strong>Name:</strong> Her name 'Santosh' means contentment, but
              she was never content with a traditional place in society.<br />
              • <strong>Clothing:</strong> While other girls wore Indian suits,
              she preferred <strong>shorts</strong>.<br />
              • <strong>Marriage:</strong> In her village (Joniyawas, Haryana),
              girls were married off at 16. Santosh refused and threatened she
              would never marry if she didn't get a proper education.<br />
              • <strong>Education:</strong> She left home for Delhi. When her
              parents refused to pay fees, she politely informed them she would
              work part-time. They eventually agreed to pay.

            <h4>🌟 The Aravalli Inspiration</h4>
            <p>
              While studying at Maharani College, Jaipur, her room faced the
              <strong>Aravalli Hills</strong>. She used to watch villagers going
              up and vanishing. Curiosity led her to check it out herself. She
              found mountaineers who encouraged her to join them. This was the
              turning point.

              This part highlights the sacrifices and mental toughness of
              <strong>Maria Sharapova</strong>. A Russian girl who reached the
              summit of women's tennis, becoming World No. 1 in 2005. Her story

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Separation from Mother</h4>
            <p>
              At the tender age of <strong>nine</strong>, Maria was packed off
              from Siberia (Russia) to Florida (USA) for tennis training. Her
              father, Yuri, went with her, but her mother, Yelena, could not go due
              to visa restrictions. This <strong>two-year separation</strong>
              from her mother was a heart-wrenching sacrifice for a young child.

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>🎾 Overcoming Bullying</h4>
            <p>
              In the hostel, Maria was younger than the other trainees. The
              seniors would return at 11 PM and wake her up, ordering her to
              tidy up the room and clean it. Instead of getting depressed, Maria
              became more determined and mentally tough.

                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> She treats tennis as a business and

              💡 Q2: How did Santosh save her fellow climbers?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> During the 1992 Everest mission, she
              provided special care to a climber at the South Col (who sadly
              died). However, she managed to save another climber,
              <strong>Mohan Singh</strong>, by sharing her own oxygen with him.
              Without her help, he would have died.

              💡 Q3: What is Maria Sharapova's mantra for success?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Maria is very competitive, hard-working,
              and mentally tough. She considers the sacrifices she made worth
              it. She says, "I work hard at what I do." She views tennis as a
              business and a sport, with money as a motivation but being No. 1
              as the ultimate goal.
