          A story by Katherine Mansfield about a child's changing perspective
          towards her strict father.
        </p>

        <div class="notes-content">
          <h2 class="chapter-heading">1. Introduction to the Story</h2>

          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>📖 Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>"The Little Girl"</strong> is a story about the complex
              relationship between a young girl named <strong>Kezia</strong> and
              her father. Initially, she views him as a figure of fear and
              discipline. However, through a series of events, her perspective
              shifts from fear to understanding, realizing that beneath his
              strict exterior lies a loving heart.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 The Central Idea</h4>
            <p>
              Think of Kezia's father like a coconut—hard and tough on the
              outside, but soft and sweet on the inside. Children often
              misinterpret parental strictness as a lack of love, but this story
              shows that discipline is often a form of care, and parents get
              tired just like anyone else.

            <h4>⚡ Kezia</h4>
            <p>
              • <strong>Fearful:</strong> She is terrified of her father and
              often stutters in his presence out of nervousness.<br />
              • <strong>Innocent:</strong> She tries to please her father (by
              making the pin-cushion) but accidentally makes a mistake.<br />
              • <strong>Observant:</strong> She watches the neighbors, the
              Macdonalds, and realizes that not all fathers are the same.<br />
              • <strong>Affectionate:</strong> She longs for her father's love
              and comfort.

            <p>
              • <strong>Figure of Fear:</strong> described as "big" with huge
              hands and neck; Kezia compares him to a giant.<br />
              • <strong>Strict Disciplinarian:</strong> Believes in punishment
              to teach lessons (hitting Kezia with a ruler).<br />
              • <strong>Hardworking:</strong> He is too tired after work to play
              like Mr. Macdonald.<br />
              • <strong>Hidden Softness:</strong> He eventually comforts Kezia
              during her nightmare, showing his caring side.

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>🎁 The Mistake</h4>
            <p>
              Grandmother suggested Kezia make a <strong>pin-cushion</strong>
              out of yellow silk as a birthday gift for her father. Kezia
              stitched three sides but needed something to stuff it with. She
              found some papers on her mother's bedroom table and tore them up
              to stuff the cushion.

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚠️ The Consequence</h4>
            <p>
              The papers were actually Father's <strong>great speech</strong>
              for the Port Authority. When he found out Kezia had destroyed
              them, he was furious. He did not listen to her explanation and hit
              her palms with a <strong>ruler</strong> to teach her not to touch
              things that didn't belong to her.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>The Nightmare:</strong> While her mother and grandmother
                were at the hospital, Kezia was alone with the cook, Alice. She
                had a terrifying nightmare about a <strong>butcher</strong> with
                a knife and a rope.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Comfort:</strong> She woke up shivering to find her
                father beside her bed. He carried her to his room, tucked her
                up, and let her snuggle under his arm.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Understanding:</strong> Kezia realized her father was
                not a monster. He was just a poor man who worked so hard he was
                too tired to be a Mr. Macdonald. She felt his heart beating and
                said, <em>"What a big heart you've got, Father dear."</em>

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">4. Important Questions & Answers</h2>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>💡 Q1: Why was Kezia afraid of her father?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Kezia was afraid of her father because he
              was very strict, loud, and domineering. He never spoke to her
              lovingly and often scolded her. His physical appearance—big hands,
              neck, and loud mouth—also terrified her, making him seem like a
              giant.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q2: What was the "hue and cry" in the house one day?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> There was a huge commotion because
              Father's important speech for the Port Authority was missing. The
              servants were questioned, and finally, Kezia admitted that she had
              torn the papers to stuff her father's birthday pin-cushion.

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q3: How did Kezia's feelings towards her father change?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Her feelings changed when she had a
              nightmare while alone. Her father comforted her, took her to his
              bed, and made her feel safe. She realized that he worked very hard
              and was too tired to play. She understood that his strictness was
              not hatred, but his way of caring, and that he had a "big heart."
