          A humorous narrative about a doctor, his vanity, and a terrifying

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">1. Introduction to the Story</h2>

          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>📖 Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>"The Snake and the Mirror"</strong> is a story within a
              story. It is narrated by a <strong>Homeopathic Doctor</strong> to
              a group of people. He recounts a frightening yet funny incident
              from his bachelor days when a cobra fell on him, but his life was
              saved because the snake became fascinated by its own reflection in
              a mirror.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 The Central Theme</h4>
            <p>
              The story explores the theme of <strong>Vanity</strong> versus
              <strong>Reality</strong>. The doctor is initially obsessed with
              his looks (vanity), but the sudden arrival of death (the snake)
              makes him realize his helplessness and foolishness (reality). It
              humorously suggests that even animals might be capable of vanity!

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ The Doctor's Room</h4>
            <p>
              The doctor lived in a small, rented room which was not
              electrified. It was an outer room with one wall facing the open
              yard.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Roof:</strong> Tiled, supported by long gables.</li>
              <li><strong>Ceiling:</strong> There was no ceiling.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Wildlife:</strong> It was infested with rats that ran to
                and fro on the beam.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Belongings:</strong> A black coat, white shirt, some
                dhotis, a vest, and about sixty rupees in a suitcase.

            </ul>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">3.1 The "Earth-Shaking" Decisions</h3>

          <div class="key-points">
            <h4>🔑 In Front of the Mirror</h4>
            <p>
              It was a hot summer night. The doctor could not sleep, so he sat
              in front of a large mirror. Admiring his beauty, he made two
              "important" decisions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To <strong>shave daily</strong> and grow a thin moustache to
                look more handsome.
              </li>
              <li>
                To always keep an <strong>attractive smile</strong> on his face
                because he was a bachelor and a doctor.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">3.2 The Terrifying Encounter</h3>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>🐍 The Snake's Arrival</h4>
            <p>
              Suddenly, there was a dull thud. As the doctor turned, a fat snake
              wriggled over the back of the chair and landed on his shoulder. Before
              he could react, the snake coiled around his left arm above the
              elbow. Its hood was spread out, hardly three or four inches from
              his face.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 Turned to Stone</h4>
            <p>
              The doctor sat there like a <strong>"stone image in the flesh."</strong>
              He realized the irony: moments ago he was proud of his looks, but
              now facing death, he remembered he didn't even have any medicine
              for snakebite in the room. He felt like a "poor, foolish, and
              stupid doctor."
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">3.3 The Escape</h3>

          <div class="key-points">
            <h4>🔑 Saved by the Mirror</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The snake turned its head and saw its reflection in the mirror.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fascinated by its own beauty, it uncoiled from the doctor's arm
                and moved onto the table to get a closer look.
              </li>
              <li>
                Taking this opportunity, the doctor quietly got up, ran out of
                the room, and didn't stop until he reached a friend's house.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">4. Important Questions & Answers</h2>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q1: What kind of woman did the doctor want to marry and why?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> He wanted to marry a woman doctor who had
              plenty of money and a good medical practice. He also wanted her to
              be <strong>fat</strong> so that if he made a silly mistake and had
              to run, she would not be able to catch him!
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q2: "I was but a poor, foolish and stupid doctor." When does
              he say this?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> He thinks this when the snake is coiled
              around his arm. Facing death, he realizes his vanity was baseless.
              He remembers he doesn't even have medicines for snakebite in his
              room, which humbles him.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q3: What did the doctor find when he returned to his room the
              next morning?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> He found that a thief had removed almost
              everything, except for his <strong>dirty vest</strong>. The thief
              had a sense of cleanliness and left the dirty vest behind as a
              final insult!

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Extract Based Question</h4>
            <p>
              <em>"Was it admiring its own beauty? Was it trying to make an
              important decision about growing a moustache...?"</em><br /><br />
              <strong>a) Who is thinking these lines?</strong><br />
              The doctor is thinking this about the snake.<br /><br />
              <strong>b) Why is he thinking this?</strong><br />
              Because the snake was looking intently into the mirror, just as
              the doctor had done earlier. It highlights the humorous parallel
              between the doctor's vanity and the snake's behavior.
