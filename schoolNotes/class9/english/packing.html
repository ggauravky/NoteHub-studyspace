            <h4>📖 Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>"Packing"</strong> is a humorous story by <strong>Jerome
              K. Jerome</strong>. It features three friends—<strong>Jerome</strong>
              (the narrator), <strong>George</strong>, and <strong>Harris</strong>,
              along with their dog <strong>Montmorency</strong>. As they prepare
              for a boat trip, their attempt to pack their bags turns into a
              comedy of errors, exposing their clumsiness and forgetfulness.

            <h4>⚡ The Trio + The Dog</h4>
            <p>
              • <strong>Jerome:</strong> Prides himself on his packing skills but
              is extremely forgetful (especially about his toothbrush). He wants
              to supervise but ends up doing all the work.<br />
              • <strong>Harris & George:</strong> They are lazy and terrible at
              packing. They break things, step on food, and create a mess.<br />
              • <strong>Montmorency:</strong> A fox terrier whose ambition in
              life is to get in the way and be sworn at. He thinks lemons are
              rats!

          <h3 class="sub-heading">3.1 Jerome's Packing Ordeal</h3>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 The Boss vs. The Worker</h4>
            <p>
              Jerome offered to pack, intending to "boss the job" while Harris
              and George pottered about under his directions. Instead, they took
              him literally, lit their pipes/cigars, and sat down to watch him
              work! Jerome hates people sitting around when he is working.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="key-points">
            <h4>🔑 Jerome's Three Mistakes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>The Boots:</strong> Just as he finished packing, Harris
                asked if he'd put the boots in. Jerome had to reopen the bag to
                put them in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Toothbrush:</strong> A recurring nightmare! He
                couldn't remember if he packed it. He had to turn everything
                out. He finally found it inside a <strong>boot</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Spectacles:</strong> After repacking everything, he
                realized he had packed his spectacles inside. He had to reopen
                the bag again.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">3.2 Harris and George's Turn</h3>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>🧈 The Butter Incident</h4>
            <p>
              Harris and George started with breaking a cup. The highlight was
              the <strong>butter</strong>. George stepped on it. They scraped it
              off his slipper and tried to put it in the kettle. It wouldn't go
              in, and what was in wouldn't come out. Finally, they put it on a
              chair, and Harris sat on it! It stuck to him, and they spent ages
              looking for it.

          <h3 class="sub-heading">3.3 Montmorency's Contribution</h3>
          
          

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ The Dog's Ambition</h4>
            <p>
              Montmorency came and sat down on things just when they were wanted
              to be packed. He put his leg into the jam. He pretended that the
              <strong>lemons were rats</strong> and got into the hamper and
              "killed" three of them before Harris hit him with a frying pan.

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">5. Important Questions & Answers</h2>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q1: Why did Jerome volunteer to do the packing?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Jerome volunteered because he prided
              himself on his packing skills. However, his real intention was to
              <strong>supervise</strong> the work while George and Harris did
              the actual labour. He was annoyed when they sat down and let him
              do everything.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q2: Describe the incident with the toothbrush.
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Jerome often forgot if he had packed his
              toothbrush. It haunted him. He had to unpack everything to find
              it. He found George's and Harris's brushes eighteen times over,
              but couldn't find his own. Finally, he found it inside a boot and
              had to repack once more.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q3: What does the author say about Montmorency?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> The author says Montmorency's ambition is
              to get in the way and be sworn at. If he can squirm in anywhere
              where he isn't wanted and make people mad, he feels his day has
              not been wasted. He was a "born nuisance."

          <div class="key-points">
            <h4>🔑 Themes to Remember</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Humour:</strong> The story relies on slapstick comedy
                (slipping on butter, sitting on things) and irony.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Friendship:</strong> Despite the annoyance, the friends
                tolerate each other's clumsiness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Chaos:</strong> Even simple tasks like packing can
                become complicated if not planned well.
