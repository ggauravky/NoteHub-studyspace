          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>📖 Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>"The Fun They Had"</strong> is a science fiction story
              written by <strong>Isaac Asimov</strong>. It is set in the future,
              specifically <strong>May 17, 2157</strong>. The story contrasts
              the future computerized school system with the traditional school
              system of the past (our present time).

            <h4>🌟 The Central Idea</h4>
            <p>
              Imagine a world where there are no classrooms, no human teachers,
              and no classmates. You sit alone in front of a computer screen in
              your bedroom to learn. This story explores whether technology can
              truly replace the social aspect and "fun" of a traditional school.

              • <strong>Personality:</strong> Curious, naive, and dislikes her
              current mechanical schooling method.<br />
              • <strong>Role:</strong> She keeps a diary (dated May 17, 2157)
              recording the discovery of a "real book." She longs for the old
              kind of schools where children played and learned together.

            <h4>🔑 Technology vs. Human Interaction</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Dehumanization:</strong> The story highlights how too
                much dependence on technology can lead to isolation. Margie
                studies alone and misses the fun of social interaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The "Fun":</strong> The title refers to the fun the
                children of the past had by going to school together, helping
                each other with homework, and spending time with friends.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Education System:</strong> While the mechanical teacher
                is efficient and personalized, it lacks empathy, emotion, and
                the ability to make learning enjoyable.

            <h4>💡 Why Margie Hated School</h4>
            <p>
              Margie hated school because it was mechanical, boring, and
              repetitive. She had to sit alone in front of a machine. Her hatred
              increased when the mechanical teacher kept giving her geography
              tests, and she kept performing poorly. She hoped the Inspector
              would take the teacher away, but he fixed it quickly.

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>💡 Q1: What kind of teachers did Margie and Tommy have?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Margie and Tommy had mechanical teachers.
              They were large, black screens on which lessons were shown and
              questions were asked. These teachers were kept at home, and they
              had a slot where students had to put their homework and test
              papers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>💡 Q2: Why did Margie's mother send for the County Inspector?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Margie had been given test after test in
              geography by the mechanical teacher, and she had been doing worse
              and worse. Her mother was worried that there was a fault with the
              machine or Margie, so she sent for the County Inspector to check
              it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>💡 Q3: What did the County Inspector do?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> The Inspector smiled at Margie and gave
              her an apple. He took the teacher apart. He found that the
              geography sector was geared a little too quick for an average
              10-year-old. He slowed it down to an average 10-year level and
              reassembled the teacher.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>💡 Q4: What was strange about the book Tommy found?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> The book was very old. Its pages were
              yellow and crinkly. It was awfully funny for them to read words
              that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to
              on a screen. Also, when they turned back to the previous page, it
              had the same words on it that it had when they read it the first
              time.

            <h4>⚡ Extract Based Question</h4>

              Tommy is the speaker.<br /><br />
              <strong>b) What does 'regular' mean here?</strong><br />
              Here, 'regular' refers to the mechanical teacher that Tommy and
              Margie are used to.<br /><br />
              <strong>c) Why is it surprising that it was a man?</strong><br />
              In their time (2157), teachers are machines. They cannot imagine a
              human being smart enough to teach.
