            <h4>📖 Overview</h4>
            <p>
              This chapter gives us a glimpse into the childhood of
              <strong>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</strong> (former President of
              India). Set in the island town of <strong>Rameswaram</strong>, it
              highlights the influence of his parents, his friends, and his
              teachers in shaping his character. It explores themes of communal
              harmony, breaking social barriers, and the importance of
              upbringing.

            <h4>⚡ Abdul Kalam's Parents</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Jainulabdeen (Father):</strong> Although he had little
              formal education or wealth, he possessed great innate wisdom and
              generosity of spirit. He was austere but provided all
              necessities.<br /><br />
              <strong>Ashiamma (Mother):</strong> A kind and hospitable lady.
              She fed more outsiders every day than all the members of her own
              family put together.

            <h4>🔑 Kalam's Childhood Friends</h4>
            <p>
              Kalam had three close friends, all from orthodox Hindu Brahmin
              families. Their friendship proves that religion does not create
              barriers.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Ramanadha Sastry:</strong> Son of the high priest of
                Rameswaram temple. Later, he took over the priesthood from his
                father.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Aravindan:</strong> Went into the business of arranging
                transport for visiting pilgrims.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sivaprakasan:</strong> Became a catering contractor for
                the Southern Railways.

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>📰 World War II Impact</h4>
            <p>
              During World War II (1939), there was a demand for tamarind seeds.
              Kalam collected and sold them, earning 1 anna per day. Later, the
              train halt at Rameswaram was suspended, and newspapers had to be
              bundled and thrown from the moving train. Kalam helped his cousin
              <strong>Samsuddin</strong> catch these bundles, earning his
              first wages. He felt a surge of pride in earning his own money.

            <h4>⚡ The Science Teacher's Lesson</h4>
            <p>
              When <strong>Sivasubramania Iyer</strong> invited Kalam for dinner,
              his orthodox wife refused to serve a Muslim in her ritually pure
              kitchen. The teacher didn't get angry; he served Kalam himself and
              sat beside him to eat. Observing this, his wife's attitude
              changed. The next time Kalam visited, she took him inside the
              kitchen and served him herself.

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">4. Leaving Rameswaram</h2>

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 The Seagull Quote</h4>
            <p>
              When Kalam asked permission to leave Rameswaram to study in
              Ramanathapuram, his father agreed. He quoted Khalil Gibran to
              console Kalam's hesitant mother:<br /><br />
              <em>"Your children are not your children. They are the sons and
              daughters of Life's longing for itself... You may give them your
              love but not your thoughts. For they have their own
              thoughts."</em><br /><br />
              <strong>Meaning:</strong> Parents must let children fly free like
              seagulls to explore the world and find their own path.

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">5. Important Questions & Answers</h2>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q1: How did Lakshmana Sastry react to the new teacher's
              behavior?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher and
              told him strictly not to spread the poison of social inequality
              and communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children. He
              told the teacher to either apologize or quit the school.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q2: "Once you decide to change the system, such problems have
              to be confronted." Who said this and why?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Sivasubramania Iyer (the science
              teacher) said this to Kalam. He meant that fighting against deep-rooted
              social norms (like caste segregation) is difficult and one faces
              resistance, but one must remain firm to bring about change.
            </p>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q3: What characteristics does Kalam say he inherited from his
              parents?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> From his father, he inherited
              <strong>honesty and self-discipline</strong>. From his mother, he
              inherited <strong>faith in goodness and deep kindness</strong>.

            <h4>🔑 Themes to Remember</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Communal Harmony:</strong> Rameswaram was a place where
                Hindus and Muslims lived together peacefully.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Power of Education:</strong> Teachers play a crucial
                role in either building bridges or walls between children.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Parental Support:</strong> Kalam's parents were his
                pillars, providing him with values and the freedom to pursue his
                dreams.
