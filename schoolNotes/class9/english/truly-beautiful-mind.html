            <h4>📖 Why "Beautiful Mind"?</h4>
            <p>
              The title <strong>"A Truly Beautiful Mind"</strong> may seem
              unusual for a scientist. We usually associate "beautiful" with
              art or people. However, this story highlights that Einstein wasn't
              just a genius in physics; he was a humanitarian who advocated for
              <strong>world peace</strong> and <strong>non-violence</strong>.
              His concern for mankind makes his mind truly beautiful.

              • <strong>Birth:</strong> March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany.<br />
              • <strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> His head seemed much too
              large. His mother thought he was a "freak."<br />
              • <strong>Late Talker:</strong> He didn't speak until he was two
              and a half years old. When he did, he repeated everything twice.<br />
              • <strong>"Brother Boring":</strong> He didn't know what to do
              with other children, so his playmates called him Brother Boring.
              He played by himself with mechanical toys.

              what profession Albert chose because <em>"he will never make a
              success at anything."</em> History proved this prediction horribly

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 The "Patent Office" Years</h4>
            <p>
              In 1902, Einstein got a job as a technical expert in the patent
              office in Bern. While he was supposed to be assessing other
              people's inventions, he was secretly developing his own ideas. He
              jokingly called his desk drawer the <strong>"Bureau of
              Theoretical Physics."</strong>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>🚀 The Year 1905: Annus Mirabilis</h4>
            <p>
              Einstein published his <strong>Special Theory of
              Relativity</strong>. <br /><br />
              <strong>Key Formula:</strong> E = mc² <br />
              (Energy = Mass × Speed of Light squared)<br /><br />
              
              <br/>
              This showed that mass and energy are interchangeable.

          </div>

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ General Theory of Relativity (1915)</h4>
            <p>
              This theory provided a new interpretation of gravity. In 1919, a
              solar eclipse proved his theory correct. The newspapers called it
              a <strong>"Scientific Revolution."</strong> He received the
              <strong>Nobel Prize for Physics</strong> in 1921.

            <h4>🔑 The Atomic Bomb</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>The Threat:</strong> When the Nazis came to power in
                Germany (1933), Einstein emigrated to the USA. Scientists feared
                the Nazis would build an atomic bomb.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Letter:</strong> At the urging of a colleague,
                Einstein wrote a letter to the American President, <strong>Franklin D.
                Roosevelt</strong>, on August 2, 1939, warning him about the
                destruction such a bomb could cause.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Regret:</strong> The Americans secretly developed
                the bomb and dropped it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Einstein was
                "deeply shaken" by the extent of the destruction.

            <h4>💡 Work for Peace</h4>
            <p>
              After the war, Einstein wrote a public missive to the United
              Nations proposing the formation of a <strong>world
              government</strong>. Unlike his letter to Roosevelt, this made no
              impact. However, over the next decade, he became more involved in
              politics, campaigning for an end to the arms buildup and using his
              popularity to campaign for <strong>peace and democracy</strong>.

            <h4>
              💡 Q1: Why did Einstein leave the school in Munich for good?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Einstein hated the regimentation (strict
              discipline) of the school in Munich. He felt stifled and often
              clashed with his teachers. He wanted a more liberal environment to
              study, so he left the school.

            <h4>💡 Q2: Why did Einstein call his desk drawer at the patent office the "Bureau of Theoretical Physics"?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> While his job was to assess the inventions of others, Einstein was secretly working on his own ideas and theories of physics. He kept his papers in his desk drawer, jokingly referring to it as the "Bureau of Theoretical Physics."

            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> He was deeply shaken by the extent of the
              destruction. He wrote a public missive to the United Nations
              proposing a world government to prevent such wars in the future.
