          A touching story by Kenneth Anderson about the deep friendship between
          a human family and a rescued sloth bear named Bruno.

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">1. Introduction</h2>

          <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>📖 Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>"The Bond of Love"</strong> highlights the emotional bond
              between the author's wife and her pet bear, <strong>Bruno</strong>
              (later named Baba). The story proves that wild animals also have
              feelings, memory, and the capacity to love and be loved. It challenges
              the notion that dangerous beasts cannot be tamed by affection.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">2. The Rescue</h2>

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ How they found Bruno</h4>
            <p>
              Two years prior, the author and his companions were passing through
              sugarcane fields near Mysore. People were driving away wild pigs.
              Suddenly, a sloth bear appeared and was unfortunately shot by one
              of the author's companions. They found a <strong>baby bear cub</strong>
              riding on the mother's back. The author managed to catch it and
              presented it to his wife in Bangalore.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="key-points">
            <h4>🔑 Life at Home</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Naming:</strong> The wife was delighted and named him
                'Bruno'.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Diet:</strong> Initially fed milk from a bottle, Bruno soon
                started eating everything: porridge, vegetables, fruits, nuts,
                meat, eggs, chocolates, and even drinking tea, coffee, and beer!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Companions:</strong> He became friendly with the
                Alsatian dogs and the children of the tenants.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">3. Accidents and Incidents</h2>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>⚠️ Incident 1: Barium Carbonate</h4>
            <p>
              The author had put down <strong>Barium Carbonate</strong> (a poison)
              in the library to kill rats. Bruno entered and ate some of it.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Effect:</strong> Paralysis set in; he could not stand on his
              feet. He was rushed to a vet.<br />
              <strong>Cure:</strong> The vet injected 10 cc of antidote followed
              by another 10 cc. Bruno recovered completely and began eating
              again.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>⚠️ Incident 2: Engine Oil</h4>
            <p>
              Bruno drank a gallon of <strong>old engine oil</strong> which the
              author had drained from his Studebaker car and kept to use against
              termites. Surprisingly, it had <strong>no ill effects</strong> on
              him whatsoever!
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">4. Separation and Reunion</h2>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">4.1 The Separation</h3>
          <p>
            As Bruno grew, he became equal in height to the Alsatians and was
            very mischievous. He had to be chained for safety. The family
            decided to send him to the <strong>Mysore Zoo</strong>. The author's wife was inconsolable, weeping and refusing to eat.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">4.2 The Visit (3 Months Later)</h3>
          
          

          <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>🌟 Memory of Love</h4>
            <p>
              Friends told the wife that the bear would not recognize her.
              However, the moment she reached the cage, Bruno recognized her
              from yards away and howled with happiness. She ran to him, petted
              him through the bars, and he stood on his head in delight.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">4.3 The Return</h3>
          <p>
            Seeing their bond, the <strong>Zoo Superintendent</strong> was kind
            enough to release Bruno back to them. He provided a cage for
            transport.
          </p>

          <div class="key-points">
            <h4>🔑 The Island Home</h4>
            <p>
              At home, a special <strong>island</strong> was made for Bruno
              (now called Baba):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>20 feet long and 15 feet wide.</li>
              <li>Surrounded by a dry pit (moat) 6 feet wide and 7 feet deep.</li>
              <li>A wooden box with straw was provided for him to sleep in.</li>
              <li>His toys (a gnarly stump and a bamboo stick) were returned to him.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 class="chapter-heading">5. Important Questions & Answers</h2>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q1: "Love is mutual." Illustrate with reference to the story.
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> The story clearly shows love is mutual.
              The author's wife loved Bruno deeply, treating him like a child. In
              return, Bruno, though a wild animal, reciprocated this love. He
              was miserable at the zoo without her, fretting and refusing food.
              When she visited, his joy knew no bounds, proving his love was
              just as strong as hers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q2: Why was Bruno sent to the zoo?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Bruno had grown very large in size. He
              could be dangerous to the children of the tenants. He had to be
              kept chained most of the time. Therefore, it was decided that he
              should be sent to the zoo for everyone's safety.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <h4>
              💡 Q3: How did the author's wife reach the island?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> The author tied a rope to the overhanging
              branch of a mango tree with a loop at its end. Putting one foot in
              the loop, she kicked off with the other to bridge the six-foot gap
              of the moat to reach the island.

          <div class="important-note">
            <h4>⚡ Extract Based Question</h4>
            <p>
              <em>"We all missed him greatly: but in a sense we were relieved."</em><br /><br />
              <strong>a) Who does 'we' refer to?</strong><br />
              'We' refers to the author, his family, and friends.<br /><br />
              <strong>b) Who did they miss?</strong><br />
              They missed Bruno (the bear).<br /><br />
              <strong>c) Why were they relieved?</strong><br />
              They were relieved because keeping a fully grown bear at home was becoming dangerous and difficult to manage.
